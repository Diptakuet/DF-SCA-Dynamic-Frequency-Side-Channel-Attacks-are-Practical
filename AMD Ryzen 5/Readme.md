# Website Fingerprinting on AMD Ryzen 5
## Google-Chrome Scenario:
`cd Chrome/` <br/>
The website fingerprinting is tested with six different scaling governors avaialable in our device. The default scaling governor of AMD Ryzen 5 is ondemand. The folders are named based on the scaling governors. As example, we will explain the scanario of deafult scaling governor ondemand. The explanation will be consistent with other governors as well. <br/>
